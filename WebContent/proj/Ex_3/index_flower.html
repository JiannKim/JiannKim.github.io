                            <p class="disc">
                                The uilip is the national flower of leran and Turkey, and tulip motifs feature prominently in Persian and Turkish folk arts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The European name for the flower comes from the Persian word for turban, a origin probably originating in the common Turkish custom of wearing flowers in the folds of the turban. 
                            </p>

                                Martagons appreciate some shade, and are quite decorative in the woodland garden. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Along with the earliest of the asiatics, blooms another entirely different group called the martagons, or martagons hansonii hybrids. These are tall lilies with many little down-facing flowers and whorled leaves.

                            <p class="disc">
                                Pears are native to temperate regions of the Old World, from western Europe and north Africa east right across Asia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The flowers are white, rarely tinted yellow or pink, 2-4 cm diameter, and have five petals. Like that of the related apple, the pear fruit is a pome, in most wild species 1-4 cm diameter.

                                While the vibrant, strong sunflower is a recognized worldwide for its beauty, it is also an important source of food.

                            <p>
                                Sunflower oil is a valued and healthy vegetable oil and sunflower seeds are enjoyed as a healthy, tasty snack and nutritious ingredient to many foods.
